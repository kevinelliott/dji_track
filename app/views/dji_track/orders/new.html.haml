%h1 Add Your Order

%p.alert.alert-info
  You should add your
  %strong Mavic Pro
  order to the list if you are not already on it. This will allow us
  to monitor your order for progress, share basic information about your 
  order with others, and get a sense of how DJI is shipping these orders out.

%p.alert.alert-warning
  If your order is from the merchant 
  %strong DJI
  then we will attempt to retrieve your order from 
  #{link_to "DJI's Order Tracking page", 'https://store.dji.com/orders/tracking'}. If you notice your order not automatically updating, you may use the
  #{link_to 'DJI command-line tool', 'http://github.com/kevinelliott/dji'}
  running on your computer. If you need to change your entry, just resubmit this form again with the same
  Order ID and Phone Tail, but with different information in the Details section.
